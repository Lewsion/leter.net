# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution.

## Scope

This repository is currently for the static `leter.net` landing page only.

## Guidelines

1. Keep changes minimal and focused.
2. Preserve legal-safe wording:
   - Do not claim currently deployed self-hosted end-to-end encryption.
   - Keep current Forward Email routing disclosure intact unless infrastructure changes.
3. Avoid adding backend services, databases, or form processors.
4. Keep styling consistent with the current dark minimal design.

## Local Check

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Pull Requests

- Use clear commit messages.
- Describe what changed and why.
- Include screenshots for UI changes.
