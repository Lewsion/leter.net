        The domain was acquired independently and remained unused for a long period while no clear
        deployment goal was defined.

        The name <span class="text-text">leter.net</span> was later retained because it is a direct
        phonetic derivative of <span class="text-text">letter</span> and aligns with a communication-first identity.

        domain reputation before any larger platform decision is made.
